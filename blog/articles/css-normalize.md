## Evil CSS Differences Between OS's
I was originally discouraged from finishing this website. I got bored of the project and it was potentially too ambitious as my first endeavour in the *fascinating* world of web development. It didn't help that I ran into a bug when I tried to show my friend Omar my website. When he opened it on his Mac machine, everything was misplaced and out of line. It was a disaster!

I found this helpful tool called normalize.css, and normalizes all the default css values that could be affected by the operating system. The internet has so many helpful tools to save idiots like me :smile:

This is my first article written using markdown and vim! Coolio!
