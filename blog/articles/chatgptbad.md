As a zoomer with no patience and that gimme gimme gimme mindset, I would never take the time to learn JavaScript, React, Next.js, CSS, HTML, and any other bullshit that would be required to write and host a personal website. Obviously, I would just use ChatGPT to write the whole thing for me!

Unfortunatley, this seemingly easy route to a functional website led to some problems. Specifically, that at the end of it, I still had no idea how to code in JavaScript! How could this have happened!

Here's my theory.

###The Theory
I am currently reading a book which leant a helpful explanation to the described phenomenon. *Rationality for Mortals* by Gerd Gigerenzer discusses how the human and animal minds operate and make decisions. In one chapter, it describes how children learn language. They start with small, simple sentences. Once they have mastered the basics - they can move on to more complex sentences. This same phenomen was observed when trying to teach a CNN how to formulate sentences. If the training data was made up of complex sentences, the model wasn't able to accurately generate new complex sentences. Instead, by feeding the model simple sentences then working up to complex sentences, the model was able to learn the basic rules of language; once it had the basic rules, it could understand the structure of more complex ones.

What does this have to do with coding?

Learning a regular language and learning a coding language have a lot of similarities. While learning a coding language, you start with simple syntax and functionality. Once you learn these building blocks, you can use them to perform increasingly complex tasks. Learning to code with ChatGPT is like trying to learn English by reading *The Brothers Karamazov*.

Without the core fundamentals of the language, you couldn't possibly see how the larger sentences and structures operate. It would appear to you as gibberish. 

ChatGPT only gives you the final product of coding, without giving you the nuanced and sometimes meticulous rules that dictate how pieces of code fit together. For example, you could ask ChatGPT how to search for a string in a directory. It may give you something that looks like this:

		grep -rl --exclude-dir=baddir "posts.map" ./ 

Now you would know how to find the given string recursively through a directory, but because you may not know what -rl means, you may not be able to search through just one file, or pipe your output to another program, just as some examples. 

The alternative to this is to use something like man pages (which funnily enough Adolf Hitler forgot to include with Windows when he released the OS in 1943). When using man pages and other manuals, you are forced to learn the simple parts before you are able to do anything. That's my innovative advice for doing things - read the manual.

The problem with relying soley on ChatGPT to make your coding projects is that it creates an  ability ceiling to the AGI driven coder. While you can build medium complexity programs that the LLM can gather from it's training data, if you ever wanted to code something that goes beyond the limits of ChatGPT's abilities (something requiring any novelty or creativity at all), you would not be able to do so.

This is why I have tried to move away from ChatGPT when learning a new coding related skill. Mom, I promise I'm off the GPT, this next.js app really is going to be efficient!
